= Developing Custom Gradle Types

There are several different kinds of "add-ons" to Gradle that you can develop, such as <<custom_plugins.adoc#custom_plugins,plugins>>, <<custom_tasks.adoc#custom_tasks,tasks>>,
<<custom_plugins.adoc#sec:getting_input_from_the_build,project extensions>> or <<dependency_management_attribute_based_matching.adoc#implementing_artifact_transforms,artifact transforms>>,
that are all implemented as classes and other types that can run on the JVM.
This chapter discusses some of the features and concepts that are common to these types.
You can use these features to help implement custom Gradle types and provide a consistent DSL for your users.

This chapter applies to the following types:

- Plugin types.
- Task types.
- Artifact transform parameters types.
- Extension objects created using `ExtensionContainer.create()`, for example a project extension registered by a plugin.
- Objects created using an `ObjectFactory.newInstance()`.
- Elements of a `NamedDomainObjectContainer`.

== Configuration using bean properties

The custom Gradle types that you implement often hold some configuration that you want to make available to build scripts and other plugins.
For example, a download task may have configuration that specifies the URL to download from and the file system location to write the result to.
This configuration is represented as Java bean properties.

Kotlin and Groovy also provide conveniences for declaring Java bean properties, which make them good language choices to use to implement Gradle types.
These conveniences are demonstrated in the samples below.

Gradle also provides some conveniences for implementing types with bean properties.
A property may be _mutable_, meaning that it has both a getter method and setter method, or _read-only_, meaning that it has only a getter method.
Gradle can provide an implementation of a property. This is called a _managed property_, as Gradle takes care of managing the state of the property.

[NOTE]
====
Managed properties are currently an experimental <<feature_lifecycle.adoc#feature_lifecycle,incubating>> feature.

=== Mutable managed properties

To declare a mutable managed property, add an abstract getter method and an abstract setter method for the property to the type.

Here is an example of a task type with a `uri` property:

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.Mutable managed property
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/mutableManagedProperty/java/buildSrc/src/main/java/UrlProcess.java[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.Mutable managed property
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/mutableManagedProperty/kotlin/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/UrlProcess.kt[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.Mutable managed property
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/mutableManagedProperty/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/UrlProcess.groovy[]
----

Note that for a property to be considered a mutable managed property, _all_ of the property's getter methods and setter methods must be `public` or `protected` and `abstract`.

=== Read-only managed properties

To declare a read-only managed property, add an abstract getter method for the property to the type.
The property should not have any setter methods (otherwise it is not read only).
This is a useful pattern to use with one of Gradle's configurable <<lazy_configuration.adoc#lazy_configuration,lazy property>> types.

Here is an example of a task type with a `uri` property:

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.Read-only managed property
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/readOnlyManagedProperty/java/buildSrc/src/main/java/UrlProcess.java[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.Read-only managed property
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/readOnlyManagedProperty/kotlin/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/UrlProcess.kt[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.Read-only managed property
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/readOnlyManagedProperty/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/UrlProcess.groovy[]
----

Note that for a property to be considered a read only managed property, _all_ of the property's getter methods must be `public` or `protected` and `abstract` and the property must not have any setter methods.
In addition, the property must have one of the following types:

- `Property`
- `RegularFileProperty`
- `DirectoryProperty`
- `ListProperty`
- `SetProperty`
- `MapProperty`
- `ConfigurableFileCollection`

=== Managed types

A _managed type_ is an abstract class or interface with no fields and whose properties are all managed.
That is, it is a type whose state is entirely managed by Gradle.

== DSL support and extensibility

When Gradle creates an instance of a custom type, it _decorates_ the instance to mix-in DSL and extensibility support.

Each decorated instance implements link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/ExtensionAware.html[ExtensionAware], and so can have extension
objects attached to it.

Note that plugins and container elements are currently not decorated, due to backwards compatibility issues.

[[service_injection]]
== Service injection

Gradle provides a number of useful services that can be used by custom Gradle types.
For example, the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor] service can be used by a task to run work in parallel, as seen in the <<custom_tasks.adoc#worker_api,worker API>> section.
The services are made available through _service injection_.

[[services_for_injection]]
=== Available services

The following services are available for injection:

- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html[ObjectFactory] - Allows model objects to be created. See <<custom_plugins.adoc#sec:nested_dsl_elements,custom plugins>> for more details.
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/ProjectLayout.html[ProjectLayout] - Provides access to key project locations. See <<lazy_configuration.adoc#sec:working_with_files_in_lazy_properties,lazy configuration>> for more details.
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/provider/ProviderFactory.html[ProviderFactory] - Creates `Provider` instances. See <<lazy_configuration.adoc#lazy_configuration,lazy configuration>> for more details.
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/workers/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor] - Allows a task to run work in parallel. See <<custom_tasks.adoc#worker_api,the worker API>> for more details.

=== Constructor injection

There are 2 ways that an object can receive the services that it needs. The first option is to add the service as a parameter of the class constructor.
The constructor must be annotated with the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation.
Gradle uses the declared type of each constructor parameter to determine the services that the object requires.
The order of the constructor parameters and their names are not significant and can be whatever you like.

Here is an example that shows a task type that receives an `ObjectFactory` via its constructor:

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.Constructor service injection
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/constructorServiceInjection/java/buildSrc/src/main/java/UrlProcess.java[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.Constructor service injection
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/constructorServiceInjection/kotlin/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/UrlProcess.kt[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.Constructor service injection
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/constructorServiceInjection/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/UrlProcess.groovy[]
----

=== Property injection

Alternatively, a service can be injected by adding a property getter method annotated with the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation to the class.
This can be useful, for example, when you cannot change the constructor of the class due to backwards compatibility constraints.
This pattern also allows Gradle to defer creation of the service until the getter method is called, rather than when the instance is created. This can help with performance.
Gradle uses the declared return type of the getter method to determine the service to make available. The name of the property is not significant and can be whatever you like.

The property getter method must be `public` or `protected`. The method can be `abstract` or, in cases where this isn't possible, can have a dummy method body.
The method body is discarded.

Here is an example that shows a task type that receives a two services via property getter methods:

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.Property service injection
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/propertyServiceInjection/java/buildSrc/src/main/java/UrlProcess.java[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.Property service injection
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/propertyServiceInjection/kotlin/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/UrlProcess.kt[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.Property service injection
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/propertyServiceInjection/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/UrlProcess.groovy[]
----

== Creating nested objects

A custom Gradle type can use the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html[ObjectFactory] service to create instances of Gradle types to use for its property values.
These instances can make use of the features discussed in this chapter,  allowing you to create 'nested' instances and a nested DSL.

In the following example, a project extension receives an `ObjectFactory` instance through its constructor.
The constructor uses this to create a nested object and makes this object available through the `greeter` property.

[source.multi-language-sample,java]
.Nested object creation
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/nestedObjects/java/buildSrc/src/main/java/DownloadExtension.java[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,kotlin]
.Nested object creation
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/nestedObjects/kotlin/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/DownloadExtension.kt[]
----
[source.multi-language-sample,groovy]
.Nested object creation
----
include::{samplesPath}/userguide/plugins/nestedObjects/groovy/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/DownloadExtension.groovy[]
----
